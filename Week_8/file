Project: Personal Portfolio Website
As part of my final week in the frontend development phase of my internship, I am working on  building a responsive and visually appealing personal portfolio website. This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience in a structured and interactive way.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (react.js)
âœ¨ Key Features:

ðŸ“± Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

ðŸ“‚ Project showcase section with descriptions and links

ðŸ“¬ Contact form with validation

ðŸŒ€ Smooth navigation and animations and will try to add more sections and features if required.

This portfolio will not only represent my frontend learning journey but also will serve as a professional platform to highlight my work.
